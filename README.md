#About the game

* All positions and sizes defined using a 10px em. This means that the game could be scaled up and down by changing the base font-size. This is one way to make the graphics responsive.
* The game has simple game loop which calculates delta and can be started and stopped.
* The player has to choose a difficulty level which changes the speed of the game.
* The player can mute the song and/or the sound effects.
* The player can control the character with mouse clicking and/or pressing space bar.
* The player can see his score in "real time" in the top right corner of the game.
* Hitting beets, clouds or ground will kill the player instantly.
* When player dies, he will see his score and the highscore.

* Extra features
	* Levels
	* Mouse and Spacebar for moving character
	* The game is responsive
	* Mute support for sound effects 

#Browsers tests

PS: As you can see, the player is ours truly, Daníel Brandur, riding a unicorn, trying not to hit beetroots in beetroot candy-land.
